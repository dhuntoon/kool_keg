## Operating the Mobile App

Updated Sep 26, 2022.

The mobile application will be deployed onto devices supporting the iOS and Android platforms. Execution will automatically begin when the application is launched on the aforementioned device.

To build or prototype with the program on a local machine, you must install the following dependencies.

Dependencies:
* Flutter (Flutter SDK 3.3.1)
* Android toolchain (Android SDK version 33.0.0)
* Xcode (Xcode 14.0) - for building and emulating iOS applications
* Android Studio (version 2021.2) - for emulating Android applications
